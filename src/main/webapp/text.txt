Description of the oak
    There was an oak tree at the edge of the road. Probably ten times older than the birches that made up
the forest, it was ten times thicker and twice as tall as each birch. It was a huge double-girth oak
tree with broken bitches, which had been broken off for a long time, and with broken bark overgrown
with old sores. With his huge, clumsy, asymmetrically spread gnarled hands and fingers, he stood like
an old, angry and contemptuous freak between the smiling birches. He was the only one who did not want
to submit to the charm of spring and did not want to see either spring or the sun.
    "Spring, and love, and happiness!" as if this oak tree were saying. - And how will you not get tired
of the same stupid and senseless deception. It's all the same, and it's all a hoax! There is no
spring, no sun, no happiness. Look, there are crushed dead fir trees, always lonely, and there I
spread my broken, skinned fingers, wherever they grew - from the back, from the sides; as they
grew, I stand, and I do not believe your hopes and deceptions."
    Prince Andrew looked back at e several times.
